# Balance Bot final project Mechatronics and Robotics

# Chris Kerluke , Tyler Lemery


# This project is about utilizing software and hardware control aspects we have learned to
# Develop an automated balancing robot that has simple autonomous motion and the ability to
# move to set locations in Euclidean Space

# We utilized a Cortex M4 packaged by TI on the TM4C123GH6PM board
# We utilized TI-RTOS source code to use as a scheduler for our system

# Sensors
# We have utilized the BNO055 Sensor for the IMU data communication through I2C
# We also use two QEI sensors on each of the motors
# We are also using 3 MaxBotix Sonar Sensors with ADC
# We will also be using a USB camera connected to an Nvidia Tk1 for Vision Sensing



# Project Completion Date April 18 2017
